# SOLID Principles

## What is SOLID

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming). These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code.

* **S** - Single Responsibility Principle ([SRP](./srp))
